jupiter-labs,exciting update: introducing the new fund offerings (nfos) on jupiter!,"were thrilled to announce that our latest feature, new fund offerings (nfo), is now live and available for all users!
what is nfo?
a new fund offering (nfo) is like an ipo in the stock market, but for mutual funds. investors can purchase units of a mutual fund as soon as it launches. with an nfo, you can invest in a fund at its inception, getting early access to a promising investment.
why invest in nfos?
early access:
nfo allows you to invest in a fund at its launch price, which can be beneficial if the fund performs well over time.
diverse opportunities:
nfos often introduce innovative strategies, sectors, or themes that might not be available through existing funds, giving you access to fresh and diverse investment opportunities.
potential for high returns:
while all investments come with risks, nfos can deliver substantial returns, especially if the fund manager can capitalize on market trends and opportunities.
strategic investment:
nfos can complement your existing portfolio by adding exposure to new sectors or strategies, helping you to diversify and manage risk more effectively.

my-finance,reduce your tax liability beyond section 80c | jupiter,"like most taxpayers, you may know about the tax benefit of 1.5 lakhs available under section 80c of the income tax act, 1961. the investment options under this section include employee provident fund (epf), public provident fund (ppf), life insurance premium, tax-saving fixed deposits, and many more.
however, apart from these, there are various other investment options that can help reduce your tax liability. read on to know about other ways to save taxes.
deductions under section 80d
health insurance premium
section 80d of the income tax act, 1961 provides tax benefits on medical insurance. under this section, premium paid for purchasing health insurance for self, spouse, dependent children, and parents is eligible for tax deduction.
the maximum deduction that can be claimed depends on the members covered under the policy and their age. moreover, tax deduction of up to 5,000 is available for health check-up expenses for self or family.
medical expenses for a disabled dependent
section 80dd exempts any expenses related to the treatment of disabled dependents. some of these include training, nursing, and rehabilitation of dependents. this deduction is available to individual and hindu undivided family (huf) taxpayers.
treatment for specified diseases
under section 80ddb, individual and huf taxpayers may claim deductions on expenses incurred for treating certain specified diseases.
some of these include neurological disorders like dementia, parkinsons, ataxia, and motor neuron ailments; hematological ailments like hemophilia and thalassemia; renal failure, and malignant cancers. the deduction limit under section 80ddb is as follows:
if the age of the person undergoing medical treatment is less than 60 years, they may claim 40,000 or actual incurred expenses for the treatment, whichever is lower.
senior citizens aged over 60 years may claim 1 lakh or actual incurred expenses for the treatment, whichever is lower.
repayment of education loan (section 80e)
under section 80e, interest paid on education loan availed for self, spouse, or any student for whom you act as a legal guardian is eligible for tax deduction. you can claim the benefit for seven years from the year you begin loan repayment, or until the entire interest is paid, whichever is earlier.
however, the deduction can be claimed only if the loan is taken for pursuing higher education from an approved lender and not from relatives, friends, or family members.
interest payment on a home loan (section 24)
if you have availed of a home loan, you can claim a tax deduction on the interest component of the equated monthly installment (emi) under section 24.
the loan must be on a self-occupied property, and the maximum deduction is limited to 2 lakhs per year. on the other hand, if the loan is taken for a rented or deemed to be rented property, there is no maximum limit on the tax deduction.
therefore, you can claim the entire interest as a tax deduction.
interest payment on a home loan for first-time homebuyers (section 80ee)
first-time homebuyers can claim tax deductions of 50,000 under section 80ee of the income tax act, 1961. this is in addition to the interest deduction of 2 lakhs available under section 24.
however, the property value should be less than 50 lakhs and the home loan amount cannot exceed 35 lakhs.
interest paid on loan availed for an electric vehicle (section 80eeb)
under section 80eeb, you can claim tax deductions of up to 1.50 lakhs if you have availed of finance to buy an electric vehicle. to be eligible for this benefit, the loan should be taken between 1st april 2019 and 31st march 2023.
rent paid for accommodation (section 80gg)
another tax-saving option is available under section 80gg. if you are a salaried individual but do not receive house rent allowance (hra) or if you are self-employed, you can claim rent paid as tax deduction.
the maximum limit is 60,000 and is not available if you live in a rented house in the same city where you own a house. additionally, if you claim interest deduction under section 24, this tax benefit is not available.
interest received from savings bank account (section 80tta)
section 80tta provides taxpayers with another income tax-saving option on the interest earned on their savings accounts. the maximum benefit available is capped at 10,000 per year.
interest earned from deposits in case of senior citizens (section 80ttb)
section 80ttb offers tax benefits to senior citizens on their interest earnings. the maximum limit under this section is 50,000 per annum. senior citizens may claim tax benefits on interest earnings from deposits with post offices, banks, or co-operative banks.
long-term capital gains on the sale of residential property (section 54)
tax benefits under section 54 are available for individual and huf taxpayers. the long-term capital gains earned on the sale of a residential property owned for at least 24 months are tax exempt.
the benefit is available if you buy a new property within one year before the date of sale, or two years after the sale, or construct a house within three years from the selling date.
section 54ec also allows for exemption on capital gains earned from the sale of land or building. however, the profit must be invested in central government-specified bonds, national highways authority of india (nhai) bonds, or rural electrification corporation (rec) bonds. the maximum deduction is limited to 50 lakhs.

what is section 24 of the income tax act?
section 24 provides exemption on the interest paid on a home loan for an amount up to 2 lakhs per year for self-occupied properties. if the property is rented, the entire amount paid as interest is eligible for tax exemption. the benefits are reduced to 30,000 if the following criteria are not met:
the loan should be availed for constructing or buying a house.
the date of availing of housing finance must be after 1st april 1999.
if the property is under construction, it should be completed within five years.
how does section 80d work?
section 80d deduction cannot be claimed if the premium is paid in cash. the benefit is available if your spouse and parents are not dependent on you. however, it is not available if you pay the premium for your children who are not dependent on you. moreover, the maximum section 80d deduction limit is combined for all family members and is not available separately for each individual.
what disabilities are covered under section 80dd?
section 80dd deductions are available for ailments like blindness, autism, locomotor disabilities, cerebral palsy, low vision, hearing impairment, mental illness, leprosy-cured, and mental retardation.
who is considered disabled dependent under section 80dd?
any disabled family member including spouse, children, and parents are considered dependent under this section. in the case of a hindu undivided family (huf), any member of the huf is considered a disabled dependent.
what is the maximum deduction under section 80dd?
the maximum limit varies based on the disability. if the disabled dependent suffers from 40% of the specified ailment, tax deduction of up to 75,000 can be claimed for medical expenses incurred for the treatment.
severely disabled dependents suffer from 80% or more of the specified ailment. the maximum deduction limit under this section is capped at 1.25 lakhs for medical treatment costs.
understanding and investing in various tax-saving schemes can help reduce your tax liability by a significant amount. however, while planning your finances, you must not let just the tax savings drive your decision.
for example, do not avail of a home loan simply to claim benefits under section 24. taking advantage of the various tax deductions under the income tax act, 1961 should be a thoughtful decision.

my-finance,how to apply for a pan card? | online & offline application process | jupiter,"pan, or permanent account number, is a unique 10-digit alphanumeric identity for indian taxpayers. while applying for a pan card is optional, it is mandatory to quote your pan number for certain financial transactions, such as payments over inr 50,000.
it is also compulsory for individuals to have a pan card if they receive a taxable salary or professional fees or invest in mutual funds.
overall, the key objective of the pan card system is to act as a universal identification key for tracking financial transactions and preventing tax evasion, particularly by high net worth individuals.
who can apply for a new pan card?
anybody who earns a taxable income in india, including children and foreign nationals who pay taxes in india, must apply for a pan card with the income tax department of india. besides salaried individuals, those running a business or freelancing and earning over inr 5 lakhs in a financial year should also apply for a pan card.
even if your income isnt taxable, having a pan card is helpful when youre opening a new bank account, investing in mutual funds, or purchasing foreign currency to travel abroad.
how to apply for a pan card
the government of india has simplified the pan card application process. applicants can apply for a pan card through both online and offline methods.

for offline applications, youre required to fill up and submit form 49a for indian citizens from either of these sites and send the duly filled and signed form to the concerned authority for it to get processed.
the charges for processing your pan application
according to the income tax department, the charges for applying for pan are inr 93 (excluding goods and services tax) for an indian address and inr 864 (excluding goods and services tax) for a foreign address. applicants may choose from bank cards, demand drafts and net banking to pay the fees.

help,process for service requests - please follow this (important),"hey folks!
hope everyone is well.
weve been noticing a lot of people raising service issues in the community without going through support channels first.
lets follow a process to ease things out:
if you face any issue/challenges in the app - reach out to our customer support first. we have a strong and dependable team who is ready to help you out.
heres how you can connect with our support team:
via app chat - open the jupiter app > home page, click on the ? icon > choose your query and start chat with an agent.
email support - support@jupiter.money
call support - +91 8655055086
we wont be able to fully address issues on the community channel unless one has formally gone through support channels. hence, the resolution for your issue will be given to you via support channels itself. not the community.
this community is a place to learn, interact, and get constructive feedback. more importantly, co-create the product together!
