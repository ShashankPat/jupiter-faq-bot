jupiter-labs,Exciting Update: Introducing the New Fund Offerings (NFOs) on Jupiter!,"We‚Äôre thrilled to announce that our latest feature, New Fund Offerings (NFO), is now live and available for all users!
What is NFO?
A New Fund Offering (NFO) is like an IPO in the stock market, but for Mutual Funds. Investors can purchase units of a Mutual Fund as soon as it launches. With an NFO, you can invest in a fund at its inception, getting early access to a promising investment.
Why Invest in NFOs?
Early Access:
NFO allows you to invest in a fund at its launch price, which can be beneficial if the fund performs well over time.
Diverse Opportunities:
NFOs often introduce innovative strategies, sectors, or themes that might not be available through existing funds, giving you access to fresh and diverse investment opportunities.
Potential for High Returns:
While all investments come with risks, NFOs can deliver substantial returns, especially if the fund manager can capitalize on market trends and opportunities.
Strategic Investment:
NFOs can complement your existing portfolio by adding exposure to new sectors or strategies, helping you to diversify and manage risk more effectively.

Explore Available NFOs:
Browse through the list of available NFOs. Each listing provides detailed information about the fund, helping you make an informed decision.
Select and Invest:
If you decide to invest, you can invest One-time and/or set up an SIP in the NFO. You can make multiple one-time investments in an NFO.
Track your NFO investment:
After investing, you can track the status of your transaction in the Transaction Tab or directly through the NFOs collection.

Where can you get started?
Make sure you have the latest app version (3.0.12)
We‚Äôre excited to bring this new feature to you and can‚Äôt wait to see how you use it to achieve your investment goals. Stay tuned for more updates and tips on making the most out of NFOs!

The investment options under this section include employee provident fund (EPF), public provident fund (PPF), life insurance premium, tax-saving fixed deposits, and many more.
However, apart from these, there are various other investment options that can help reduce your tax liability. Read on to know about other ways to save taxes.
Deductions under section 80D
Health insurance premium
Section 80D of the Income Tax Act, 1961 provides tax benefits on medical insurance. Under this section, premium paid for purchasing health insurance for self, spouse, dependent children, and parents is eligible for tax deduction.
The maximum deduction that can be claimed depends on the members covered under the policy and their age. Moreover, tax deduction of up to ‚Çπ5,000 is available for health check-up expenses for self or family.
Medical expenses for a disabled dependent
Section 80DD exempts any expenses related to the treatment of disabled dependents. Some of these include training, nursing, and rehabilitation of dependents. This deduction is available to individual and Hindu Undivided Family (HUF) taxpayers.
Treatment for specified diseases
Under section 80DDB, individual and HUF taxpayers may claim deductions on expenses incurred for treating certain specified diseases.
Some of these include neurological disorders like dementia, Parkinson‚Äôs, ataxia, and motor neuron ailments; hematological ailments like hemophilia and thalassemia; renal failure, and malignant cancers. The deduction limit under section 80DDB is as follows:
If the age of the person undergoing medical treatment is less than 60 years, they may claim ‚Çπ40,000 or actual incurred expenses for the treatment, whichever is lower.
Senior citizens aged over 60 years may claim ‚Çπ1 lakh or actual incurred expenses for the treatment, whichever is lower.
Repayment of education loan (section 80E)
Under section 80E, interest paid on education loan availed for self, spouse, or any student for whom you act as a legal guardian is eligible for tax deduction. You can claim the benefit for seven years from the year you begin loan repayment, or until the entire interest is paid, whichever is earlier.
However, the deduction can be claimed only if the loan is taken for pursuing higher education from an approved lender and not from relatives, friends, or family members.
Interest payment on a home loan (section 24)
If you have availed of a home loan, you can claim a tax deduction on the interest component of the equated monthly installment (EMI) under section 24.
The loan must be on a self-occupied property, and the maximum deduction is limited to ‚Çπ2 lakhs per year. On the other hand, if the loan is taken for a rented or deemed to be rented property, there is no maximum limit on the tax deduction.
Therefore, you can claim the entire interest as a tax deduction.
Interest payment on a home loan for first-time homebuyers (section 80EE)
First-time homebuyers can claim tax deductions of ‚Çπ50,000 under section 80EE of the Income Tax Act, 1961. This is in addition to the interest deduction of ‚Çπ2 lakhs available under section 24.
However, the property value should be less than ‚Çπ50 lakhs and the home loan amount cannot exceed ‚Çπ35 lakhs.
Interest paid on loan availed for an electric vehicle (section 80EEB)
Under section 80EEB, you can claim tax deductions of up to ‚Çπ1.50 lakhs if you have availed of finance to buy an electric vehicle. To be eligible for this benefit, the loan should be taken between 1st April 2019 and 31st March 2023.
Rent paid for accommodation (section 80GG)
Another tax-saving option is available under section 80GG. If you are a salaried individual but do not receive house rent allowance (HRA) or if you are self-employed, you can claim rent paid as tax deduction.
The maximum limit is ‚Çπ60,000 and is not available if you live in a rented house in the same city where you own a house. Additionally, if you claim interest deduction under section 24, this tax benefit is not available.
Interest received from savings bank account (section 80TTA)
Section 80TTA provides taxpayers with another income tax-saving option on the interest earned on their savings accounts. The maximum benefit available is capped at ‚Çπ10,000 per year.
Interest earned from deposits in case of senior citizens (section 80TTB)
Section 80TTB offers tax benefits to senior citizens on their interest earnings. The maximum limit under this section is ‚Çπ50,000 per annum. Senior citizens may claim tax benefits on interest earnings from deposits with post offices, banks, or co-operative banks.
Long-term capital gains on the sale of residential property (section 54)
Tax benefits under section 54 are available for individual and HUF taxpayers. The long-term capital gains earned on the sale of a residential property owned for at least 24 months are tax exempt.
The benefit is available if you buy a new property within one year before the date of sale, or two years after the sale, or construct a house within three years from the selling date.
Section 54EC also allows for exemption on capital gains earned from the sale of land or building. However, the profit must be invested in Central government-specified bonds, National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) bonds, or Rural Electrification Corporation (REC) bonds. The maximum deduction is limited to ‚Çπ50 lakhs.

Understanding and investing in various tax-saving schemes can help reduce your tax liability by a significant amount. However, while planning your finances, you must not let just the tax savings drive your decision.
For example, do not avail of a home loan simply to claim benefits under section 24. Taking advantage of the various tax deductions under the Income Tax Act, 1961 should be a thoughtful decision.

my-finance,How to Apply for a PAN Card? | Online & Offline Application Process | Jupiter,"PAN, or Permanent Account Number, is a unique 10-digit alphanumeric identity for Indian taxpayers. While applying for a PAN card is optional, it is mandatory to quote your PAN number for certain financial transactions, such as payments over INR 50,000.
It is also compulsory for individuals to have a PAN card if they receive a taxable salary or professional fees or invest in mutual funds.
Overall, the key objective of the PAN card system is to act as a universal identification key for tracking financial transactions and preventing tax evasion, particularly by high net worth individuals.
Who Can Apply for a New PAN Card?
Anybody who earns a taxable income in India, including children and foreign nationals who pay taxes in India, must apply for a PAN card with the Income Tax Department of India. Besides salaried individuals, those running a business or freelancing and earning over INR 5 lakhs in a financial year should also apply for a PAN card.
Even if your income isn‚Äôt taxable, having a PAN card is helpful when you‚Äôre opening a new bank account, investing in mutual funds, or purchasing foreign currency to travel abroad.
How to Apply for a PAN Card
The Government of India has simplified the PAN card application process. Applicants can apply for a PAN card through both online and offline methods.
To apply for the card online, you may visit the
NSDL portal
or
UTITSL website
to process your application in a seamless, swift and contactless manner.
For offline applications, you‚Äôre required to fill up and submit Form 49A for Indian citizens from either of these sites and send the duly filled and signed form to the concerned authority for it to get processed.
The Charges for Processing Your PAN Application
According to the Income Tax Department, the charges for applying for PAN are INR 93 (Excluding Goods and Services tax‚Äã) for an Indian address and INR 864 (Excluding Goods and Services tax) for a foreign address. Applicants may choose from bank cards, demand drafts and net banking to pay the fees.
Online Pan Card Application Process
1. Visit the
NSDL website
to apply for a PAN card online. You can fill up all the requisite information on this site and upload the required documents to get your PAN card in a few simple steps.
2. Since you are applying for a new PAN card, click on the ‚ÄúApply Online‚Äù option on the top left of the page to proceed ahead.
3. Once you click on the Application Type, you will see a drop-down with three options:
New PAN ‚Äì Indian Citizen
New PAN ‚Äì Foreign Citizen
Changes or Correction on Existing PAN/Re-print of PAN card
4. Once you choose the required option, you will need to select the category. Assuming you choose New PAN ‚Äì Indian Citizen, you will see a category list with options like an individual, firm, an associate of persons, Hindu Undivided Family (HUF), Trust, Limited Liability Partnership (LLP), local authority, etc.
5. Once you select your category, you will be required to fill in your personal information in the following sections:

Submit via e-sign
You will have to choose between a physical PAN card and a digital PAN card. Select the documents you are going to submit as proofs for identity, address, and date of birth. Now confirm the declaration, place and date of application, review your form and proceed to the payment section after submitting your form.
9. You can choose to pay via Demand Draft or Online Payment through Bill Desk. If you select the former, you must have your demand draft ready while making the application. Online payment may be made using bank cards or net banking.
10. Click ""I agree to the terms of service"" and proceed to make the payment. The fee is different for online and offline applications. If you're paying online, you will receive a payment receipt that you must print and save.
11. After payment, you may choose to send the documents physically or authenticate your application with Aadhaar Authentication using the ‚ÄúAuthenticate‚Äù option. Once you choose this option, click on ""Continue with e-KYC"" to receive an OTP on your mobile number linked to your Aadhaar.

The third method is the e-sign method, wherein you need an Aadhaar and also upload scanned copies of photographs, signature and other documents. An OTP will authenticate this application form.

If your PAN card is lost or stolen, you should go with the option of reprinting your PAN card without changing any information.
What You Should Remember While Applying for a PAN Card

Ensure that you provide a valid address, phone number and email ID in your application.

general,All telecom operators should allow free data to Digital Rupee apps. ,"Every Bank have an additional app promoting digital indian currency Digital Rupee. But I don‚Äôt think people even use these apps. If possible, telecom operators can allow such apps to work even when user doesn‚Äôt have any active plan.
They can also make other UPI payments chargeable except payments done on Digital Rupee App.
What you guys think about this app and it‚Äôs future?"

Hope everyone is well.
We‚Äôve been noticing a lot of people raising service issues in the community without going through support channels first.
Let‚Äôs follow a process to ease things out:
If you face any issue/challenges in the app - reach out to our customer support first. We have a strong and dependable team who is ready to help you out.
Here‚Äôs how you can connect with our support team:
Via App chat - Open the Jupiter app > Home page, click on the ? icon > Choose your query and start chat with an agent.
Email support - support@jupiter.money
Call support - +91 8655055086
We won‚Äôt be able to fully address issues on the community channel unless one has formally gone through support channels. Hence, the resolution for your issue will be given to you via support channels itself. Not the community.
This community is a place to learn, interact, and get constructive feedback. More importantly, co-create the product together!
